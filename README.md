# FF6 Day-Night Cycle Project

This is a revival of my day-night cycle hack project that was about
90% completed back in 2018 but that was then abandoned.

## Base hack roadmap
- [x] Redo project structure
- [x] Create basic build script
- [x] Redo data spreadsheets
- [x] Convert the project from xkas 0.06 to bass v14
- [ ] Correct any bug with the code conversion
- [ ] Add to project compatible save files archive
- [ ] Test playthrough covering all changes and bugfixes if needed
- [ ] Improve code comments and documentation
- [ ] Beta testing round
- [ ] Release version 1.0 of the base hack
