# FF6 Day-Night Cycle Project

This is a revival of my day-night cycle hack project that was about
90% completed back in 2018 but that was then abandoned.

## Base hack roadmap
- [x] Redo project structure
- [x] Create basic build script
- [ ] Redo data spreadsheets
- [ ] Convert the 2018 xkas 0.06 code to bass v18 code
- [ ] Finish at 100% the base hack
- [ ] Beta test round
- [ ] Release version 1.0 of the base hack
